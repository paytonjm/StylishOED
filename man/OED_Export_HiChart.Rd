\description{
Export a Highcharts (highcharter) object to an HTML file for use on QualityInfo.org.
This helper function is designed to recognize different chart types and extract the
minimum script needed to generate a dynamic chart, using CSS classes and structure
aligned with those used on QualityInfo.org.
}
\details{
\strong{Key features:}
\itemize{
  \item Accepts a Highcharts object and pulls all options stored in JSON.
  \item Assumes QualityInfo.org already has \code{highcharts.js} loaded, so no script
        tags are needed in the document header.
  \item Prompts for naming the output file (no need to type \code{.html}).
  \item Saves an HTML file styled for QualityInfo.org, with CSS classes integrated for
        OED management.
  \item Can include skip logic or accessibility attributes to improve screen reader behavior.
}
}
\section{Requirements}{
\itemize{
  \item Requires the \code{rstudioapi} and \code{htmltools} packages.
  \item Users should review the Division style guide to ensure all colors and contrasts
        meet accessibility requirements.
